# ðŸ§  Machine Learning - Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)

This is a notebook about using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for image classification: Is it tumoral tissue or not?

This individual practical work involved replicating a public notebook addressing a Kaggle competition on detecting lymphatic tissue tumors, while personally adding detailed explanations in Spanish throughout the code. It encompassed my learning of various topics such as libraries, methods, attributes, and syntax, aiming to convey technical concepts in a more accessible manner.

The goal is to cater to beginners, ensuring comprehensive understanding without the need for extensive documentation searches, thereby providing a more convenient study resource.
